    <p> My favourite cartoon character is Shin-chan. Shin-chan, is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Yoshito Usui. This follows the adventures of the five-year-old Shinnosuke "Shin" Nohara and his parents, baby sister, dog, neighbours, and friends and is set in Kasukabe, Saitama Prefecture of Japan. I like this cartoon a lot because it makes mre laugh. It a subsitute of laughter for me in every time of my life like when I am sad, angry,etc.
        Many of the jokes in the series stem from Shin-chan's occasionally weird, unnatural and inappropriate use of language, as well as from his mischievous behaviour. <br> Some of his facts are as follows: <br>
